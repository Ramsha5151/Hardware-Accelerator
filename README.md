# 🚀 Design of a Hardware Accelerator for Convolution in Image Processing and its Verification 
### 📝 Project Objective
Design and verify a high-performance hardware accelerator for **2D Convolution operations**, a core component in image processing and CNNs. The design is optimized for power, area, and speed, and verified against a MATLAB golden reference model.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design
The accelerator follows a modular RTL approach to ensure efficient hardware mapping:
- **Line Buffer:** Implements a sliding window mechanism to stream pixels and manage row-based data reuse.
- **MAC Unit:** A dedicated Multiply-Accumulate unit optimized for 3x3 kernel operations.
- **FSM Controller:** Orchestrates the data flow, ensuring precise timing and `valid_out` synchronization.

### 🔌 Hardware Schematic (RTL Analysis)
The following image displays the RTL Schematic generated by Vivado, illustrating the interconnected modules and data flow within the hardware design.
